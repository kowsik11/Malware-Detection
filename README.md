# 🛡️ Malware Detection Project

## 🚀 Overview
This project focuses on detecting malicious software (**malware**) using advanced machine learning techniques. It analyzes malware based on both **static** and **dynamic** features, enhancing detection accuracy and scalability. The goal is to detect malware that might evade signature-based or static analysis methods. 

## 🔍 Approach
We use two main approaches to detect malware:
1. **Static Analysis** 🧑‍💻: Identifies malware using internal code features from binary or executable files.
2. **Dynamic Analysis** ⚙️: Detects malware by analyzing its behavior in a controlled environment, helping identify advanced threats that static methods might miss.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models
Three machine learning algorithms were applied to improve detection accuracy and minimize false positives/negatives:
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** 📊
- **Random Forest** 🌳
- **Logistic Regression** 📝

These models extract and analyze key features from malware samples to distinguish between benign and malicious files.

## ⚠️ Challenges
- **False Positives & Negatives** ⚠️: ML models can sometimes flag benign files as malware (false positives) or miss malicious files (false negatives), which require manual review to avoid missing critical threats.
- **Feature Selection** 🔑: Selecting relevant features from malware samples is critical for accuracy and efficiency, as irrelevant features may reduce model performance.

## 🛠️ Libraries and Modules
- **[Numpy](https://numpy.org/)**: Perform a variety of mathematical operations on arrays.
- **[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **[Pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html)**: Serialize data into binary format and deserialize it back into Python objects.
- **[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)**: Creating visualizations.
- **[Sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)**: An open-source data analysis library used for machine learning models.

## 💻 Frontend
The project includes a **user-friendly interface** that allows users to upload a file. The system analyzes the file and classifies it as either benign or malware based on the extracted features and behavior analysis.

## 📦 Installation
To run the project locally, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/malware-detection.git
cd malware-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
